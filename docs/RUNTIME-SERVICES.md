# Runtime Services

Helm remains a small-service boat system, not a single monolith. The current
repo is a working hybrid: core nav/chart runtime is already C++, while Python
still exists for weather/reference paths, data tooling, fixtures, and optional
AI/community experiments. The target maintained product is smaller:
**required boat-side runtime daemons are C++/CMake/OpenCPN-native by default**,
and the cockpit remains browser JavaScript/WebGPU.

The final acceptance gate for this policy is [HELMCXX-ACCEPTANCE.md](HELMCXX-ACCEPTANCE.md). That
contract defines what must be C++, what may remain outside required runtime, and what evidence is
required before the runtime can be called C++-only.
The checked-in machine-readable inventory is
[runtime-inventory.json](runtime-inventory.json), and its guard is:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-runtime-inventory.py
python3 scripts/helmcxx-parity-suite.py
bash -n scripts/helmcxx-no-python-runtime.sh
node --check scripts/helmcxx-benchmark-soak.mjs
node --check scripts/helmcxx-maintainability-audit.mjs
```

This is an architecture guardrail, not a rewrite order to stop all product work
or break working helpers before parity exists. The rule is:

- C++ owns required boat/runtime infrastructure.
- Browser JavaScript/WebGPU owns the cockpit UI and client rendering.
- Python may remain for AI/lab/dev tooling, fixture generation, transitional
  reference/oracle implementations, and explicitly optional non-safety companion services.
- The existing optional `backend/` FastAPI companion is frozen by a baseline in
  `runtime-inventory.json`: new `backend/**/*.py` files or FastAPI routes must
  add an explicit inventory exception with owner and rationale, plus a C++ exit
  task if the path is trending toward required runtime.
- Data-preparation tools and test harnesses stay outside required boat runtime unless
  they become part of a shipped boat appliance path.
- Any non-C++ daemon that becomes required for normal chartplotter runtime needs a frozen contract
  and a C++ ownership decision before it can be accepted.
- Service boundaries are still the desired shape. The target is small, testable C++ services, not
  one giant process.

## Current Versus Target

| Surface | Current status | Target status |
|---|---|---|
| `helm-server` nav/chart core | C++ one-origin boat server | C++ required runtime |
| `helm-packd` local packs | C++ port merged; Python oracle may remain for tests | C++ required runtime |
| tile cache/proxy | C++ cache/proxy merged for runtime use | C++ when enabled |
| weather/environment grid packs | C++ `helm-envd` first replay/validation slice exists; Python `services/wx` remains reference/oracle and provider bridge until full parity | C++ `helm-envd`/`helm-wxd` grid-pack service required runtime after parity |
| `backend/` FastAPI/AI/community | Optional prototype/companion path; current Python files and routes are explicitly baselined | Optional non-safety only, or ported if ever promoted to required runtime; no net-new backend Python or route surface without an inventory exception |
| `pipeline/` and generators | Python and shell tooling | Allowed outside required runtime; selected appliance paths may be ported |
| `web/` cockpit | Browser JavaScript/MapLibre/WebGPU | Browser JavaScript/WebGPU product UI |

## Maintainability Bar For C++ Services

The OpenCPN maintainer concern is valid: generated code often becomes wide, clever, inconsistent,
and hard to review. Helm's answer is not "write faster." The answer is that runtime C++ work must
be boring, bounded, and reviewable.

Every C++ runtime service port must follow this bar:

- **Contract first.** Freeze the HTTP/file contract and golden fixtures before the port.
- **Small vertical slices.** Land one capability at a time: health, one tile path, range request,
  catalog, then metadata.
- **Native C++ shape.** Use clear value types, narrow interfaces, RAII ownership, and explicit
  errors.
- **OpenCPN-native C++ style.** Target conservative modern C++ that fits the OpenCPN/toolchain
  baseline: CMake, C++17-shaped, standard library first, minimal dependencies.
- **One responsibility per module.** HTTP routing, cache/index storage, tile decoding, metadata
  normalization, and filesystem policy stay separate.
- **Visible failure modes.** Return explicit `404`, `204`, stale/offline, out-of-coverage, or
  invalid-pack states. Never hide missing data behind optimistic fallbacks.
- **Deterministic tests before polish.** Unit tests for pure code, fixture tests for tile/package
  behavior, and HTTP smoke tests for service surfaces are required before UI work depends on the
  port.
- **Threading is opt-in and named.** Single-threaded/simple paths are preferred until profiling
  proves otherwise.
- **Retire references after parity, not before.** Keep reference behavior until the C++ service has
  fixture parity and the client has been switched.
- **Reviewable diffs.** Prefer smaller PRs with clear before/after evidence over broad abstractions.

## Target Runtime Shape

```text
web cockpit / future native client
        |
        | HTTP + WebSocket contracts
        v
helm-server        C++  required nav/chart/safety core
helm-packd         C++  local MBTiles/PMTiles/portable package serving, catalog, layers, prefetch
helm-basemap-cache C++  optional generic cache/proxy for satellite/online-fill and remote packs
helm-envd          C++  environmental grid-pack replay, validation, inventory, and selected-pack prefetch
```

Names are provisional. What matters is the boundary:

- required boat daemons are C++/CMake/OpenCPN-native where practical;
- services speak narrow HTTP/file contracts so they can be ported without client rewrites;
- data products and caches remain bring-your-own and local-first;
- stale/offline/out-of-coverage states are explicit and testable;
- the browser remains a thin client, not a hidden owner of runtime semantics.

## Target Service Inventory

The table below is the human-readable summary. The enforceable version is
[`runtime-inventory.json`](runtime-inventory.json), which also names current
Python references/oracles, optional non-safety services, owner lanes, and C++
exit tasks. HELMC++-2 consumes that inventory through
[`helmcxx-parity-suite.json`](helmcxx-parity-suite.json), which maps each
required runtime service to its parity probes and records whether remaining
Python paths are oracle-only, dev-only, offline-bake, fixture/test, or optional
non-safety.

| Target service | Accepted role | C++ runtime decision |
|---|---|---|
| `engine/` / `helm-server` | Nav, AIS, route, chart tile, health, and one-origin boat server | Required C++ runtime. |
| `helm-packd` | Local MBTiles/PMTiles packs, catalog, layers, prefetch, bundle manifests | Required C++ runtime. |
| `helm-basemap-cache` | Cache/proxy for online fill and remote/local pack fallback | C++ when enabled as a runtime service. |
| `helm-envd` | Environmental grid-pack replay, validation, stale/offline/error reporting, and selected-pack prefetch | First C++ replay/validation slice implemented by WX-20; provider/job parity remains incremental. |
| data-preparation tools | Import, bake, conversion, sample generation, fixture tooling | Outside required runtime. |
| `web/` | Browser cockpit, MapLibre, WebGPU, UI tests | Client surface, not boat runtime daemon. |
| native Apple clients | WKWebView, SwiftUI, MapLibre Native, Metal | Thin client over the boat server. |
| dev/test harnesses | Playwright, smoke helpers, mock engines, local scripts | Outside required runtime. |

## Port Order

### 1. `helm-packd`: local pack service

Required contract:

- serve local MBTiles raster tiles;
- serve PMTiles with HTTP Range support;
- expose `/catalog`;
- expose `/layers` maritime layer inventory;
- expose `/prefetch` route/bbox cache-warming manifests;
- expose `/bundle` region-bundle manifests;
- preserve sidecar/source/freshness/coverage/inspection metadata allow-listing;
- preserve the bring-your-own-pack and local-filesystem privacy model;
- never require internet to show installed packs.

Suggested C++ shape:

- `pack_index` discovers configured packs and reads allow-listed metadata.
- `mbtiles_store` owns SQLite tile lookup and TMS/XYZ conversion.
- `pmtiles_store` owns archive metadata and byte-range serving.
- `pack_manifest` owns catalog, layer inventory, prefetch, and bundle JSON shaping.
- `pack_http` owns request parsing, response headers, and error mapping.
- `pack_fixtures` compare C++ responses against frozen fixtures.

### 2. C++ tile cache/proxy

Required contract:

- cache-first tile serving;
- stale-while-revalidate for slow-changing imagery;
- serve-stale-on-outage;
- transparent/empty fail-safe on hard miss;
- tile budget and route-pin hooks for smaller devices.

This should not decide chart semantics. It is a cache service.

### 3. `helm-envd`: environmental grid-pack service

Required contract:

- replay prepared `helm.env.grid.v1` packs;
- validate pack manifests, chunk indexes, compression, and checksums;
- serve range-addressed scalar and vector grid chunks through `helm-packd`/pack service boundaries;
- preserve valid-time and source metadata;
- avoid provider fetches during offline-mode tests;
- fail loudly for missing chunks, stale runs, unsupported compression, unsupported render capability,
  and out-of-pack requests;
- consume S-100-family metadata as provenance/portrayal data, not shader/backend policy.

The C++ service should replay prepared grid packs and run explicit selected-pack refresh/import jobs,
but it should not bake UI assumptions into the service. It must not become a monolith: package
serving, cache inventory, provider ingestion jobs, and browser rendering stay separate.

WX-20 lands the first vertical slice as [`helm_envd.cpp`](../engine/vendor/cli/helm_envd.cpp):
local-only manifest validation, sanitized `/packs` inventory, and validated `/chunk` replay for
uncompressed `HELMGRID` chunks. Unsupported capabilities fail loud; they are not hidden behind
provider calls, PNG pyramids, gateway substitution, or viewport-triggered fetches. See
[`WX-20-HELM-ENVD.md`](WX-20-HELM-ENVD.md).

The user-visible HELMC++ cockpit gate is
[`scripts/helmcxx-cockpit-proof.sh`](../scripts/helmcxx-cockpit-proof.sh). It
uses private ports only, launches the C++ runtime services together, and runs
Playwright against the real cockpit with local chart, pack, weather, health, and
nav assertions.

The HELMC++ performance/reliability gate is
[`scripts/helmcxx-benchmark-soak.mjs`](../scripts/helmcxx-benchmark-soak.mjs).
It launches the same required C++ runtime services on private ports and writes
benchmark/soak evidence for cold start, first chart/environmental layer data,
latency percentiles, concurrent clients, RSS/CPU, disk footprint, cache/no-network
behavior, crash/restart recovery, and optional baseline comparison.

The HELMC++ maintainability gate is
[`scripts/helmcxx-maintainability-audit.mjs`](../scripts/helmcxx-maintainability-audit.mjs)
plus [`HELMCXX-MAINTAINABILITY.md`](HELMCXX-MAINTAINABILITY.md). It keeps the C++ runtime service
shape boring: CMake targets, test/doc coverage, no raw ownership spread outside the named
`helm-server` adapter exception, no novelty template machinery, and explicit warning dispositions
for large files.

## OpenCPN Alignment

The OpenCPN public repo already has useful C++ seams:

- `model/` for navigation, comms, AIS, nav objects, persistence, notifications, local APIs, and
  plugin management substrate;
- `gui/include/gui` for chart DB, chart canvas, S-57 chart classes, quilting, query surfaces, and
  OpenGL canvas;
- `s57` plus `data/s57data` for S-57/S-52 chart and presentation assets;
- `include/ocpn_plugin.h` for extension capabilities, overlay callbacks, vector object access, and
  plugin data-flow discipline;
- `cli` for bounded command/headless proof slices.

Helm runtime-service cleanup should mirror that pattern: contract first, adapter boundary second,
small C++ vertical slice third.

## Non-Goals

- Do not collapse services into one process merely to reduce the process count.
- Do not move optional advisory/community features into the safety core.
- Do not block client/environment rendering proof on premature service rewrites.
- Do not introduce new required non-C++ daemons.

## HELMC++ Acceptance

The runtime-service policy is accepted only after the HELMC++ gate passes:

- required boat/runtime daemons are C++;
- no required non-C++ daemon remains;
- reference behavior has parity evidence before retirement;
- `scripts/helmcxx-no-python-runtime.sh` passes on private ports with explicit C++ binary paths;
- `scripts/helmcxx-cockpit-proof.sh` passes against `helm-server`, `helm-packd`,
  `helm-basemap-cache`, and `helm-envd` on private ports with retained
  screenshots/artifacts;
- the cockpit passes a C++-only Playwright proof;
- `scripts/helmcxx-benchmark-soak.mjs` records performance, reliability, no-network,
  crash/restart, dependency-footprint, and soak evidence;
- `scripts/helmcxx-maintainability-audit.mjs` passes and warning dispositions are carried into the
  final dossier;
- `scripts/helmcxx-packaging-proof.sh` passes and
  [`HELMCXX-PACKAGING.md`](HELMCXX-PACKAGING.md) documents fresh-machine
  macOS plus Linux/Raspberry-Pi-style install paths without Docker;
- performance, reliability, soak, and maintainability evidence is recorded.
