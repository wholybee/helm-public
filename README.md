# Helm

**One screen for everything on the water.**

Helm is a **local-first boat server** with **thin cockpit clients** — browser, tablet, or native shell — all talking to one origin on the boat LAN. The safety core runs headless: OpenCPN-derived navigation and true **S-52 vector ENC** chart rendering over HTTP/WebSocket. The cockpit composites charts, satellite, weather, AIS, routes, tides, and instruments into **one situational picture**.

Not a cloud dashboard. Not four apps duct-taped together. **One system.**

> **North Star:** UI + intelligence on top of **probeable, citable boat state** — tap the chart object, trust the alarm, ask the boat and get engine-backed answers. Full vision: [docs/NORTH-STAR.md](docs/NORTH-STAR.md).

Helm is source-available and **pre-alpha**. It is not a packaged macOS app, Windows installer, Linux package, or mobile app yet. The current public alpha is a working hybrid: C++ `helm-server` (OpenCPN `model/` + S-52/S-57 renderer) plus a MapLibre/WebGPU browser cockpit. Python remains in weather/reference services and optional non-safety AI experiments.

Today's cruiser bounces between Windy, PredictWind, a weather app, and a chartplotter. Nothing shows it all on one screen, offline, with honest freshness. **That is the product.**

## How it fits together

Helm is **one system, not several loose apps**: a headless boat server with thin
clients around it. If the directory layout looks like "a few projects in different
languages," this is the hierarchy that ties them together.

| Part | Language | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`engine/` → `helm-server`** | C++ | The safety core. A headless OpenCPN-derived navigation + S-52 chart engine that serves `/nav`, `/chart`, `/catalog`, and `/health` on one local origin. |
| **`web/`** | Browser / MapLibre | The cockpit UI — a thin client over the server. Runs on the same machine or another display on the boat LAN. |
| **runtime services** | C++ target | Local package serving and cache/proxy behavior are already moving into C++; environmental bundle replay is still in transition. |
| **data preparation** | tools / scripts | Tools to generate and import *your own* local chart, depth, and weather data. These may stay outside required runtime. No chart packs are bundled. |
| **Python surfaces** | transitional / optional | Current weather/reference paths, offline tooling, fixtures, and optional non-safety AI/community services. They are not the target required boat runtime. |

```text
   web/ cockpit  ──HTTP+WebSocket──▶  engine/ helm-server (C++)  ──▶  local charts + boat data
  (browser/tablet)   one local origin      OpenCPN nav core            ENC/MBTiles · NMEA/SignalK
                                                  ▲
                                   C++ runtime services · Python/tooling references
```

The C++ process owns navigation-critical computation and chart rendering today.
The target is to move every required boat-side backend/runtime daemon behind the
same kind of narrow HTTP/WebSocket contract into C++ as well. The browser
cockpit is already the product UI and stays web-native. Full detail in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status

Pre-alpha source release. The documented build/run path is **macOS from
source**: build `helm-server`, run it on a private local port, then open
`http://127.0.0.1:9001/` in a browser. There is no native SwiftUI/iOS client yet.

Linux and Windows are not packaged or documented yet. The browser client is
portable, but the headless OpenCPN engine build currently assumes the macOS
toolchain, Homebrew paths, wxWidgets 3.2, and Helm's bootstrap script.

The current code includes a reusable data pipeline + MapLibre browser client,
plus a one-origin [Helm Engine](engine/) that drives OpenCPN's real `Routeman`
headlessly and serves S-52 ENC chart tiles over HTTP. Python weather/tooling
paths are still present because they work and are useful references while C++
runtime parity is built. The web app can show OpenCPN-rendered charts under
OpenCPN-computed navigation state when you provide chart data and NMEA/SignalK
input. See [docs/OPENCPN-REUSE.md](docs/OPENCPN-REUSE.md).

## What You Can Run Today

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS source build | Documented path. Build `helm-server`, run it locally, open the browser UI. |
| Browser UI | Reference client. Served by `helm-server`; can also be served as a static demo with `web/serve.py`. |
| Weather/environment | Hybrid today. Python `services/wx` remains the working/reference gateway while the C++ environmental daemon target is proven. |
| Optional AI/community backend | Python/FastAPI prototype. Optional, non-safety, and not required for chart/nav runtime. |
| Charts | Helm does not include chart packs. Real S-52 tiles require user-provided OpenCPN-compatible charts such as NOAA ENC `.000` cells, pointed to with `HELM_ENC`. |
| Local basemaps | User-owned MBTiles/raster packs stay local and are served at runtime; do not commit chart packs or private imagery to Git. |
| Boat data | Live movement requires NMEA 0183, SignalK, or another configured input. The server does not silently invent live boat data. |
| Windows | Alpha source build — one command (`scripts\windows\bootstrap.ps1`, 32-bit/OpenCPN-native). See [docs/BUILD-WINDOWS.md](docs/BUILD-WINDOWS.md). |
| Linux | Not a one-command supported path yet. Expect porting/dependency work. |
| Native desktop/mobile app | Not shipped yet. |

## The three differentiators

1. **One fused screen.** Charts, satellite, the full weather stack, your route, AIS
   targets and instruments, composited as toggleable layers on a single chart —
   instead of four apps and a guess.
2. **On-demand charts + depth-on-satellite.** Lasso an area, fetch charts, cache them
   offline — the live version of [ChartLocker](https://chartlocker.brucebalan.com) —
   and overlay ENC depth soundings *on top of* satellite imagery, so you see the reef
   **and** the numbers. (Inspired by the S-57 depth rendering in
   [wholybee/chartplotter](https://github.com/wholybee/chartplotter).)
3. **Own weather + open routing.** Windy's whole layer catalog (wind, gust, swell,
   wave, rain, current, pressure, cloud) rendered from public GRIB as *our own*
   composited overlay — offline, no ToS strings — plus PredictWind route import and
   our own isochrone weather router.

## Reviewer Path In 10 Minutes

For a skeptical first pass, use the public docs in this order:

1. Read [docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md](docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md) and
   [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) to see what Helm is, what works
   today, and what is still pre-alpha.
2. Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) before treating any screenshot or demo as a
   navigation claim.
3. Build and run from [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md). Use a private local
   port such as `9001`, provide your own chart data, and verify `/health`,
   `/catalog`, and a sample `/chart/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` tile.
4. Run `engine/test-engine.sh` after a build to exercise the one-origin server,
   chart route, navigation behavior, containment checks, and smoke coverage.
5. For the renderer proof context, read
   [docs/VULKAN-HELM-WEBGPU-PROOF.md](docs/VULKAN-HELM-WEBGPU-PROOF.md) and the
   OpenCPN proof branch it links to. Helm is the WebGPU-first consumer path;
   VSG/Vulkan is the OpenCPN/native proof backend.

Internal business strategy, product requirements, feature audits, roadmap/epic plans,
release-post drafts, UI mockups, raw research artifacts, live-machine notes, and local
operator configuration are intentionally kept out of the public repository.

## Navigation Safety

Helm is pre-alpha marine navigation software. It is not certified, not
type-approved ECDIS, not carriage-compliant, and not a substitute for official
charts, notices, instruments, watchkeeping, or seamanship. Treat it as a
supplemental evaluation tool only.

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) before running Helm, sharing screenshots, posting a
demo, or inviting testers.

## Requirements

There is intentionally no root runtime dependency file: Helm is a C++ boat
server plus browser client, with Python still used for current helper services,
tooling, fixtures, and optional non-safety experiments. Dependencies are scoped
to the part you are running.

| Area | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Main macOS runtime | Xcode CLT, Homebrew, `wxwidgets@3.2`, `gpatch`, `cmake`, `gdal`, `node` |
| C++ engine | Built by `engine/bootstrap.sh`; see [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) |
| Web tests | `web/test/package.json` |
| Current Python helpers | Scoped under `services/`, `pipeline/`, and optional `backend/`; not the target required runtime |
| Runtime chart data | NOAA ENC `.000` cells, pointed to with `HELM_ENC` |
| Runtime basemap data | User-owned MBTiles/raster packs served locally, outside Git |
| Runtime boat data | NMEA 0183, SignalK, or configured connection input |

## Contributing

The public alpha is being shaped into a contributor-friendly project. If you
want to help, start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md),
[docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md](docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md), and
[docs/REPO-MAP.md](docs/REPO-MAP.md).

Useful first contributions include setup reports, build fixes, docs, web-client
tests, platform notes, chart-data onboarding examples, and small UI improvements.
Please keep private chart packs, private basemaps, credentials, generated
caches, and vessel-sensitive data out of issues and pull requests.

## Quick Start (macOS)

The current public-alpha path is the one-origin `helm-server`: it serves the
browser UI, `/nav`, `/chart`, `/catalog`, and `/health` on one private port.

```bash
brew install wxwidgets@3.2 gpatch cmake gdal node
engine/bootstrap.sh
scripts/install-sample-enc.sh
scripts/start-helm.sh --port 9001 --fill

open http://127.0.0.1:9001/
```

Use [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for the short first-run path, then
[docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) for NOAA ENC setup, NMEA/SignalK input, and
end-to-end verification. In the shared development environment, do not use `:8080`;
use a private development port instead.

## Bring Your Own Charts

Helm does not ship Steve's private charts, private satellite packs, `~/.helm`
runtime data, or generated gigabytes of chart/cache output. The public repo is
code plus safe sample/public data.

For real charting, provide your own local chart data at runtime:

- point `HELM_ENC` at an OpenCPN-compatible ENC `.000` file for S-52 rendering;
- generate or copy user-owned depth overlay GeoJSON into `~/.helm/data`, or set
  `HELM_USER_DATA_ROOT` to another local data directory;
- serve your own MBTiles/raster basemap packs locally if you want chart or
  imagery underlays;
- keep private chart packs, downloaded imagery, and runtime caches outside Git.

The app serves that local data directory at same-origin `/user-data/` and
prefers those user-owned overlays over the bundled `web/data` demo fixtures.

The optional `Online fill` layer is an internet/cache underlay for filling gaps
beneath local/user-owned charts. It is off by default and is not a replacement
for proper local chart data.

## The tracer bullet (first code)

Prove the magic before architecting anything. A macOS spike that:

1. renders a MapLibre map,
2. lets you lasso a bounding box and fetches Sentinel-2 + NOAA ENC for it,
3. packs the tiles into mbtiles and caches them offline,
4. overlays ENC `SOUNDG`/`DEPCNT` depth on the satellite imagery, and
5. drops a GRIB wind layer on top.

If that one screen feels good, the project is real and de-risked. The cross-platform
core then *emerges from working code* rather than upfront architecture.
